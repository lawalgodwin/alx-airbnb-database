# Monitor and Refine Database Performance

**Objective**: Continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans and making schema adjustments.

### Instructions:

- Use SQL commands like `SHOW PROFILE` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to monitor the performance of a few of your frequently used queries.

- Identify any bottlenecks and suggest changes (e.g., new indexes, schema adjustments).

- Implement the changes and report the improvements.
